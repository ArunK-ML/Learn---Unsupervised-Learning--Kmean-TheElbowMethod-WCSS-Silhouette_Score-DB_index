1. Unsupervised Learning Overview Goal: Discover hidden patterns in data without labels
ðŸ”¹ 2. Clustering Algorithms: K-Means
âœ… K-Means:
Objective: Group data into k clusters.

How it works:

Initialize k random centroids

Assign each point to nearest centroid (based on Euclidean distance)

Recalculate centroids

Repeat until convergence
